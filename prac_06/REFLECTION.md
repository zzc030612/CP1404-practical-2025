## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have started prioritizing planning before coding by reading the entire task thoroughly and breaking it into smaller steps. This has helped me avoid confusion and reduce errors during implementation.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to improve my time management by setting stricter deadlines for each task and sticking to them. Additionally, I need to focus on testing more thoroughly and not rushing through it.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am consistently documenting my code and writing clear, concise commit messages. I also make an effort to understand the concepts behind each exercise instead of just completing the tasks.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop procrastinating and avoid relying on last-minute efforts to complete practicals. I also need to reduce dependency on IDE features and practice writing code independently to strengthen my programming skills.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

It would be helpful to include more real-world examples and projects in the subject to demonstrate how the concepts we learn are applied in industry. Additionally, more opportunities for collaboration with peers on practical tasks could enhance learning and teamwork skills.
